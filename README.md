# Self Driving Car using Tensorflow 2.0+ and Keras
Dataset contains of images recorded from a car dashcam with labeled steering angles. Approximately 63,000 images, 3.1GB. Data was recorded around Rancho Palos Verdes and San Pedro California.
This repo have implementation of simple regression based ConvNet model to predict the steering angle.
